Primary "ilities" that interest me are: 
- Scalability : the way to design and develop systems in order for them to scale in the areas of data storage, business login/analytic processing, and presentation/visualization. 
- Simplicity (strictly not an ility) : with the plethora of technologies being developed to do the same things in different ways, there is an art to understanding the simplest ways of achieving each use case.
- Ubiquity (strictly not an ility) : with cloud computing and online code repositories, writing and deploying software and anaytics should be acessible to everyone.

_My projects are organized in the following categories:_

### Barebones Software Development (bsd-*)

### Amazon Web Services (aws-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Amazone Web Services platform.

### Docker Images (dcr-*)
Projects that contains links to my [Docker Cloud](https://store.docker.com/profiles/deocampo) based images for different open sources technologies.

_The 'deocampo.github.io' project contains the source code for this page._

**Note** : _It would be more interesting to publish code (both software and models) from my actual work, unfortunately those are protected and may not be released._
