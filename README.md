Primary "ilities" that interest me: 
- Scalability : the way to design and develop systems in order for them to scale in the areas of data storage, business login/analytic processing, and presentation/visualization. 
- Simplicity : with the plethora of technologies being developed to do the same things in different ways, there is an art to understanding the simplest ways of achieving each use case.
- Ubiquity : with cloud computing and online code repositories, writing and deploying software and anaytics should be acessible to everyone.

Please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deocampo/) for a more "professional" understanding of my background.

_My projects are organized in the following categories:_

### Barebones Software Development (bsd-*)
Projects containing code snippets, normally executable via command line : Java Projects with a few programs on foundational concepts using Java SE 8. Python projects with a few programs that are developed and validated to be executable on Python 2.7.10. Tensorflow projects with a few models running on TensorFlow version 1.2.

### Amazon Web Services (aws-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Amazone Web Services platform.

### Google Cloud Services (gcs-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Googl Cloud Services platform.

### Docker Images (dcr-*)
Projects that contains links to my [Docker Cloud](https://store.docker.com/profiles/deocampo) based images for different open sources technologies.

_The 'deocampo.github.io' project that contains the source code for this page._

**Note** : _I know it would be more interesting to publish code (both software and models) from my actual work, unfortunately those are protected and may not be released._
