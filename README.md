There are three areas that interest me: 
- Scalability : the way to design and develop systems, in order for them to scale in the areas of data storage, business login/analytic processing, and presentation/visualization. 
- Simplicity : with the plethora of technolies being developed to do the same things in different manner, it is very interesting to understand the simplest ways of achieving each use case.
- Accessibility : with cloud computing and online code repositories, writing and deploying software and anaytics should be democritized and FREE (or at least very cheap).

For a more "professional" understanding of my background, please visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deocampo/).

_Aside from the 'deocampo.github.io' project that contains the source code for these introductory pages, my projects are organized in the following categories:_

### Barebones Software Development (bsd-*)
Projects containing code snippets, normally executable via command line.

- Java : Projects with a few programs that can be compiled and executed via command line.
- Python : Projects with a few programs that are developed and validated to be executable on Python 2.7.10.
- Tensorflow : Projects with a few models running on TensorFlow version 1.2.

### Amazon Web Services (aws-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Amazone Web Services platform.

### Google Cloud Services (gcs-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Googl Cloud Services platform.

I'd really love to do more, if I only had the time.

**Note** : _I know it would be more interesting to publish code (both software and models) from my actual work, unfortunately those are protected and may not be released._
