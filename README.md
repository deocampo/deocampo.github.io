This is a very informal, free flowing site of ideas and code that I've used to learn and enjoy software. Below are links to the major sections. For a more "professional" understanding of my background, please visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deocampo/).

_Aside from the 'deocampo.github.io' project that contains the source code for these introductory pages, my projects are organized in the following categories:_

### Barebones Software Development (bsd-*)
Projects containing code snippets, normally executable via command line.

#### Java
Projects with a few programs that can be compiled and executed via command line.

#### Python
Projects with a few programs that are developed and validated to be executable on Python 2.7.10.

#### Tensorflow
Projects with a few models running on TensorFlow version 1.2.

### Amazon Web Services (aws-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Amazone Web Services platform.

### Google Cloud Services (gcs-*)
Projects that contains activities related to publishing applications into the Googl Cloud Services platform.
